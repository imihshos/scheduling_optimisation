    "Creation of a staff schedule roster for daily operation is a time consuming process for restaurant managers, especially when the restaurant hires a large number of part-time staffs and offers flexible working hours. There are many restrictions that they have to consider, such as staff's availability for the day and the number of staff required at peak and non-peak hours to maintain customer service standards. This often results in ineffective workforce scheduling, which increases the operating expense of the restaurant since salary paid out to staff may not be optimised.\n",

    "To improve the efficiency of workforce scheduling and better manage operating expenses, an optimisation model can be used by restaurant managers to generate optimal daily working schedules that would effectively utilise available manpower and minimise operating expenses of the restaurant for higher profits. \n",
